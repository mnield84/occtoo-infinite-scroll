### Getting setup

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vite-project.git
cd vite-project

1. In a terminal type `npm install`
2. Wait a couple of minutes for everything to download
3. If that's all worked, that's all you need to do!
4. Type `npm run dev` and you should see a message a little like this in the terminal:

```bash
  VITE v4.0.4  ready in 1104 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

#### Run commands

- `npm run dev` - Starts the vite server at `localhost:5173` (by default).
